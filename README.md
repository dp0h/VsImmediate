PyImmediate
===========

Visual Studio's Immediate Window with Python syntax.
Basically this is not a true Immediate Window. The project include a Python module and VS add-on which allow to use Visual Studio Debugger expression evaluation in Python REPL, so Python REPL could be used in a similar way as VS's Immediate Window.

### Installation

### Usage

### ToDo
* Add few python helper functions for printing some hierarchy valus based on some pattern (something like xpath).
* Build python REPL to Visual Studio.
