PyImmediate
===========

Visual Studio's Immediate Window with Python syntax.
Basically this is not a true Immediate Window. The project include a Python module and VS add-on which allow to use Visual Studio Debugger expression evaluation in Python REPL, so Python REPL could be used in a similar way as VS's Immediate Window.
